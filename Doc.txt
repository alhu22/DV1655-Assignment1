build_cfg:
    loop throw root for each class.
    take the class object and symbol table of the same class.
    for every class it loop throw methods.
        new blockmethod:
            name = className.methodName

        for each method member we run runMethodBody wich take the member, new blockmethod and class symbol Table:
            node = current member we want to handle
            block = new blockmethod
            if we have a list of statements then we have Block.
            for each statement we run the runMethodBody and give it the block member.

            if we have IfStatement:
                if expr is false jump to false block
